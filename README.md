# Named-Entity-Recognition-and-Q&A-with-Transformers

The project performs named entity recognition with the help of a pre trained 'xlm-roberta-large-finetuned-conll03-english' model and then uses these tokens (name of the person and location they wish to visit) to fetch relevant answer from the given context. 

The model used for question answering is deepset/roberta-base-squad2.

Both the models are taken from Huggingface.
